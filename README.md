# About BufferOverFlow
```
Buffers are memory storage regions that temporarily hold data while it is being transferred 
from one location to another.
A buffer overflow (or buffer overrun) occurs when the volume of data exceeds the storage capacity of the memory buffer. 
As a result, the program attempting to write the data to the buffer overwrites adjacent memory locations.
